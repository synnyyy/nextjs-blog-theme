# Information
We are always eager to hear your feedback about BetterBypasser's updates and issues. I have partially listened to your opinions and a new method has been made as a result!

# Credits
All credits go to vergif (on Discord) for providing the new method. This is very appreciated by me! :heart:

- Added a new method: 3.5
 - **This method will allow you to flawless the ROBLOX filter without being restricted by a dictionary. This means 85% of the things you will say will be bypassed by a smart algorithm technology!**
