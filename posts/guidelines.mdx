# Community Guidelines

## 1.0: Follow Discord's TOS 
You must follow Discord's TOS at all times. Any actions that violates the TOS will lead to a permanent ban.

## 1.1: You need to be 13+ to use Discord
Discord requires you to be atleast 13+ to be there on their platform. If you say that you are younger than this requirement or joke about it, it will result in a permanent ban.

## 1.2 Be respectful
Respect all users, regardless of your personal preferences. Treat others with the same kindness and consideration you expect for yourself. Be a decent human being.
This means strictly avoiding any form of racism, sexism, homophobia, derogatory messages, as well as issuing death threats or engaging in doxxing.

## 1.3 Doxxing or leaking personal information, or databases is prohibited
Privacy and safety is one of our priorities at Synergy. You should not be showing sensitive information to any of our members; discussion of this will also lead to punishment. We want to make the server safe for everyone.

## 1.4 Sending malware or links isnt allowed
To prioritize the security and well-being of our community, you cannot send malware or suspicious links. Any application or link that is sent to Synergy will be deleted; bypassing of this filter will result in punishment.
