# Community Guidelines

## 1.0: Follow Discord's TOS 
You must follow Discord's TOS at all times. Any actions that violates the TOS will lead to a permanent ban.

## 1.1: You need to be 13+ to use Discord
Discord requires you to be atleast 13+ to be there on their platform. If you say that you are younger than this requirement or joke about it, it will result in a permanent ban.

## 1.2 Be respectful
Respect all users, regardless of your personal preferences. Treat others with the same kindness and consideration you expect for yourself. Be a decent human being.
This means strictly avoiding any form of racism, sexism, homophobia, derogatory messages, as well as issuing death threats or engaging in doxxing.

## 1.3 Doxxing or leaking personal information, or databases is prohibited
Privacy and safety is one of our priorities at Synergy. You should not be showing sensitive information to any of our members; discussion of this will also lead to punishment. We want to make the server safe for everyone.

## 1.4 Sending malware or links isnt allowed
To prioritize the security and well-being of our community, you cannot send malware or suspicious links. Any application or link that is sent to Synergy will be deleted; bypassing of this filter will result in punishment.

## 1.5 False allegations or rumours
Avoid spreading false allegations or rumors within the Synergy community. Verify information before sharing to maintain trust and avoid causing harm. Engage in respectful discussions based on reliable sources and refrain from promoting misinformation or unnecessary drama.

## 1.6 No NSFW and Gore content, references or topics
Talking about NSFW and gore content, referencing to it or discussing about it will lead to moderation. We also prohibit e-dating or flirting with someone in the server. Take that shit to DMs, no one wants to see that shit.

This also links to Discord profile pictures, banner, display name, name, status and the "About Me".

## 1.7 No sexualising minors
We do not care that if you are joking about owning CP. We do not care if you are under 18 and call someone "hot" that is also under 18. We don't give a fuck. **There is a zero-tolerance policy for this rule and heavy moderation will be faced.**

## 1.8 No alternative accounts
Alternative accounts are not allowed in this server; we have punished you for a reason and you have to accept that. If you feel that you have been unfairly unbanned, please appeal via Wick. Sympathy appeals are not allowed.

## 1.9 Use common sense
Not all of the rules are listed here. Use your common sense and don't do retarded things.

# Blacklisted words
The only blacklisted word is ``nigger``. Any variation of it will not be tolerated and will lead to a **permanent ban without appeal.** This rule does not apply to the word ``nigga``.
