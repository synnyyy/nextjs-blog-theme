# Where do I find the scripts?
To get the scripts, simply go to the welcome channel, click "Synergy's Services" and find the product you are looking for. However, if you are looking for BetterBypasser, there is a link which is in the most recent message. So click that.

# Why am I crashing after execution
You are using a executor which is not compatible. Examples of this are Electron and Valyse. The recommended executor for BetterBypasser is Fluxus or Fluxus-based APIs/exploits.

# How do I change the method
Simply change the `method` number to either 1 and 3. In the comments, it will tell you what the methods are.

# The UI is blank after opening Method 3
Not sure how you are getting this problem but it is not reproducible by me. I am using a modified version of Arrayfield; we will change to the official version of Arrayfield once the mobile support has released.
